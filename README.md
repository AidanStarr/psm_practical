# Practical session on Proxy System Modelling 
Created for the University of Cambridge Holocene Climates MPhil (2024/2025 cohort) by Aidan Starr. 

## Outline
WORK IN PROGRESS!!

- I'm planning for this workshop to be a JupyterBook, with a google collab or binder deployment for students to run the code and try the practical without having to deal with python dependencies on their local machines.
