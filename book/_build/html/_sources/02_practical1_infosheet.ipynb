    "The oxygen isotope composition of the calcite shells of foraminfera ($\\delta^{18}O_{calcite}$) is potentially the most important proxy in paleoceanography. Early measurements of $\\delta^{18}O_{calcite}$ on planktic foraminifera samples in deep-sea sediment cores gave us our first insight into the rythmic glacial cycles of the Pleistocene [Emiliani et al., 1955](), revealing periodic fluctiations in ocean temperature and global ice volume. \n",

    "$\\delta^{18}O_{calcite}$ is a function of the **ambient $\\delta^{18}O$ of seawater ($\\delta^{18}O_{sw}$) and the water temperature in which the foraminfera formed its shell. The relationship between $\\delta^{18}O_{calcite}$, Temperature (T) and $\\delta^{18}O_{sw}$ is often simplified as:\n",

    "Oxygen isotope measurements are usually given in \"delta\" notation, with units of \"per mille\" (a.k.a per throusand, denoted by â€°). This is because the absolute abundance of minor isotopes like $^{18}O$ can't be measured accurately, so they are instead compared to a known standard material. You can think of this as _the difference of this sample from this standard x 1000_... or: \n",
