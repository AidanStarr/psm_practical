# Introduction to Proxy System Models
by Aidan Starr

This is a JupyterBook created for the University of Cambridge Holocene Climates 2024/2025 cohort. It includes some background on PSMs, as well as interactive worksheets for building a simple PSM in python. 

The interactive worksheets are hosted on [google colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html). This means you should be able to develop and run the code without havng to deal with python dependencies on your local machine.

In case you do want to set up a python environemnt on your computer, [I've included a short guide to compiled from various online sources](python-env-primer.md).
