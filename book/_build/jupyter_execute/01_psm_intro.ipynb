    "# Introduction to Proxy System Models (PSMs)\n",
    "Paleoclimate observations are the only empirical constraint we have on what the climate system was like prior to the ~19th century. However, paleoclimate proxies are often riddled with uncertainties, both in the way they record a given climate signal and in the age of a given sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and modelling the way that a proxy system **transforms a climate signal into a measurable geological/biological/chemical/physical property** is clearly super useful for robustly interpreting paleoclimate records!\n",

    "## Calibration Equations\n",
    "To convert a paleoclimate measurement (let's say, [the Mg/Ca ratio of a foraminifera](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00294-9) shell) into a climate variable (in this case, ocean temperature), we first need some kind of transfer function. Traditionally, this might be a regression model determined by my measuring the proxy value (e.g. Mg/Ca concentration) from samples with known environmental conditions (e.g. water temperature). \n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing our Mg/Ca example, we could go out into the ocean and collect living formanifera specimens from different regions with varying water temperatures. We could then plot the temperature versus Mg/Ca concentration for all the specimens and use the relationship to obtain a **calibration equation**. For example, we could use the data in {numref}`anand-mgca-calibration` to derive the following equation:\n",
