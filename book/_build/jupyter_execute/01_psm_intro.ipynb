    "# Introduction to Proxy System Models (PSMs)\n",
    "Paleoclimate observations are the only empirical constraint we have on what the climate system was like prior to the ~19th century. However, paleoclimate proxies are often riddled with uncertainties, both in the way they record a given climate signal and in the age of a given sample. Understanding and modelling the way that a proxy system **transforms a climate signal into a measurable geological/biological/chemical/physical property** is therefore very useful for robustly interpreting paleoclimate records.\n",
